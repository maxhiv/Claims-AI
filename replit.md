# Overview

Davies CQ Ã— AI Scheduler is a comprehensive monorepo containing an AI-powered field adjuster scheduling and communication system. The application combines a Next.js Progressive Web App dashboard with multiple Node.js microservices to automate appointment scheduling, route optimization, and stakeholder communications for insurance claim processing. The system integrates with Davies CQ/CoreLogic/XactAnalysis systems and provides intelligent scheduling suggestions using OpenAI's GPT models.
