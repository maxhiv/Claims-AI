All set! I dropped in typed client adapters, provider registries, and per-service .env.example files, plus a Replit secrets template. Grab the updated monorepo here:

How to wire keys later

Open Replit → Secrets → add the keys from REPLIT_SECRETS_TEMPLATE.env.

(Optional) For local dev: copy each service’s .env.example to .env and fill in placeholder values.

Choose providers:

SMS: COMMS_SMS_PROVIDER=sms77io

Email: COMMS_EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid

WhatsApp: COMMS_WHATSAPP_PROVIDER=maytapi

Address verify: ADDRESS_VERIFY_PROVIDER=smarty|loqate

Router: ROUTER_PROVIDER=geoapify|trueway

Notes

Adapters are ready-to-implement: each has a comment where to place the exact HTTP call; env names are already baked in.

Endpoints already expose simple routes in each service (/send-sms, /optimize, etc.) so you can test wiring quickly.

Want me to also add fetch wrappers inside each adapter using undici (with retry/backoff + idempotency headers) and a small contract test under __tests__ so you can validate keys as you add them?

yes please add your suggestions

Thought for 36s

Done! I added:

Undici-powered fetch wrappers with retry/backoff and Idempotency-Key support in each service.

Updated provider adapters to use real HTTP calls (respecting DRY_RUN=1 so you can test without keys).

Contract smoke tests under __tests__ for each service to validate env detection and the happy path in dry-run mode.

Updated service package.jsons to include undici and a test script.

What changed (highlights)

New per-service helper: src/providers/http.ts

requestJSON(url, { headers, body, idempotencyKey, retries, backoffMs })

Retries on 429/5xx with jittered backoff (dev-friendly defaults: 0.5s, 1.5s, 3s).
Swap to [3000,15000,60000,180000] in prod.

Honors DRY_RUN=1 to simulate a 202 response without external calls.

Providers now call real endpoints (with DRY_RUN bypass):

comms-service: sms77io, sendgrid, maytapi, languagelayer, ai-translate, real-phone-validation, abstract-email.

routing-service: geoapify geocode, trueway-vrp (stubbed plan after POST), weatherapi, tomtom.

cq-middleware: smarty, loqate for address verification.

scheduler-service: calendarific (holiday check), abstractapi timezone.

Tests:

services/*/__tests__/providers.smoke.ts

Run with pnpm test (uses tsx). By default DRY_RUN=1, so no external traffic.

How to use in Replit / local

Add the secret names from REPLIT_SECRETS_TEMPLATE.env (values can be blank initially).

For quick verification:

pnpm i
pnpm -r build # optional, tests run TS directly via tsx
pnpm test     # runs service smoke tests (DRY_RUN=1)


When you start wiring real keys, set:

DRY_RUN=0 (or unset) in the service environment you’re testing.

The relevant provider keys (e.g., SENDGRID_API_KEY, SMS77IO_API_KEY, etc.).

Tweak points you might want next

Promote the HTTP helper to a shared package @ai-scheduler/http if you prefer single-source maintenance.

Add retry-aware idempotency keys at the gateway level (e.g., hash of normalized body).

Small OpenAPI client TS types for the gateway endpoints.

A minimal /api/events SSE endpoint and a web hook receiver for inbound SMS/WhatsApp replies to update the Comms Log in real time.

If you want, I can set the production backoff schedule and add a simple poison-queue hook (push failed requests to Redis after N attempts) so retries don’t block the request thread.
